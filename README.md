# Manifester
Cloud Foundry Manifest Generator

Manifester is a form that generates valid text for use in a Cloud Foundry manifest.yml file.  As you enter application deployment attributes in each field the output text is generated in real-time.

Simply copy-and-paste the generated text into your own deployment manifest.
